## My Vim Files

#### Install

All plugins are enabled via vundle.

To install:

> bash force-install.sh


My plugin list:

> vim ~/.vim/vim.d/plugins.vim


#### Files

Main `.vimrc` is the shortest possible: just enough to setup `vundle`
and call all other settings.

Remaining settings are in files inside `.vim/vim.d` directory.
